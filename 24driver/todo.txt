FIXME PCB
---------

[x] Fix dimensions of the joystick outline/components (it's too large)... Just ditch joystick.
[ ] Remove the low-pass capacitors for the motors. They cause the motor driver to trip on high
current, turning the outputs to ground, which discharges the cap and the cycle repeats... until
the driver overheats, duh.


TODO PCB
--------

[ ] Ditch joystick and buttons; expose remaining pins.
[ ] Adjust resistance for the motor LED. Green is stronger than orange, put higher resistance for green.
[ ] Compactiffy new layout.
[ ] Try to leave ESP32 VIN pin disconnected so we can use USB (for wired interface) and battery at the same time.
