FIXME PCB
---------

[ ] Fix dimensions of the joystick outline/components (it's too large)...
[ ] Remove the low-pass capacitors for the motors. They cause the motor driver to trip on high
current, turning the outputs to ground, which discharges the cap and the cycle repeats... until
the driver overheats, duh.


TODO PCB
--------

[ ] Adjust resistance for the motor LED. Green is stronger than orange, put higher resistance for green.
[ ] Maybe increase resistance for both, to reduce brightness a bit more.
