Hextech Mecharm
===============

4 DOF robotic arm to drive the upper arm half of the robot hand. Ball like joint using
a differential gear on the shoulder, separate motor for arm twist motion, and another
motor for the elbow. Using 3D printed cycloidal drives and a 5010 brushless motor used
in large drones, but low 360KV.

TODO:
-----
[ ] Fix elbow motor, I think star connection not properly soldered.
[ ] Place and wire potentiometers too.
[ ] Drive motors using the RTM library of the ESP32.
