Physical Mechahand Model
------------------------

1. No files for first iteration of mechahand, see [blog post](http://calin.mocanu.info/2019/06/11/mechahand-assemble.html) for pictures.
2. Mechahand II, the smallest hand version, failed due to pulley system cables passing through sharp corners. Can't have the cables passing through any corner as tensioning that wire causes large friction increase and a lot of plastic deformation of the nylon wire.
3. Mechahand III, the hand with the motors directly in the palm, failed because it's way too big and flimsy. Can't put motors on the fingers because they end up being too heavy and too big. Not way to cramp them tighter either. The 3rd version has a very modular design with each finger segment and wrist joint taken from 2 joint modules. Motorzied bigjoint is a sturdy and higher reduction joint for the wrist assembly. Motorized minijoint are perpendicularly geared joints as small as I can make with 1 motor and 1 potentiometer. Modularizing the hand was a good idea, and bigjoint is used in later versions.
