Physical Mechahand Model
------------------------

1. No files for first iteration of mechahand, see [blog post](http://calin.mocanu.info/2019/06/11/mechahand-assemble.html) for pictures.
2. Mechahand II, the smallest hand version, failed due to pulley system cables passing through sharp corners. Can't have the cables passing through any corner as tensioning that wire causes large friction increase and a lot of plastic deformation of the nylon wire.
3. Mechahand III, the hand with the motors directly in the palm, failed because it's way too big and flimsy. Can't put motors on the fingers because they end up being too heavy and too big. Not way to cramp them tighter either. The 3rd version has a very modular design with each finger segment and wrist joint taken from 2 joint modules. Motorzied bigjoint is a sturdy and higher reduction joint for the wrist assembly. Motorized minijoint are perpendicularly geared joints as small as I can make with 1 motor and 1 potentiometer. Modularizing the hand was a good idea, and bigjoint is used in later versions.
4. Mechahand IV, first fully functional version, blog post pending. Uses the motorized bigjoint module for the wrist. There are direct drive joints with in-situ motors for the thumb and pinky opposable finger grasp. The rest of the fingers are controller by 1-sided pulley system; with the other side being a passive spring. With 2-sided pulleys on the old versions, there isn't enough tension on the string to gracefully unwind the side opposite the movement direction. We end up with loose wire coming out of the motor system and tangling up. There's no way to fix it without unreasonable tension on both sides. I therefore choose a single side pulley with a passive spring which keeps the system always in tension. We only need to be careful not to unwind when there's an external blocker.
5. Mechahand V, with neat finger shrouds! Fingers actuated again from 2 sides using the double pulley. Finger covers can hide the wiring to make it prettier. Using silicon wires leading to the motor system with a plastic soldering helper. Much neater to solder together, though putting the wires in place is difficult. Ok design on first sight, but multiple problems make it unusable. The little tubes are to stiff for the sideways finger wiggle. The printer springs are much too strong and have very little give. Difficult assembly requires a lot of force and moving about to get it to clamp down. When the clamp releases the spring fully extend and because the PTFE compression is too much. Overall too much friction to move the fingers when fully tensioned, and too little give in the tensioning system. Shrouds cover the wires though, will keep those. But thicker and mounted with screws so they can be used effectively.
6. Mechahand VI. First build and maybe usable hand! replaced the 6 to 1 buncher with 3 tube pairs that bunch into a single thick-ish tube leading to each joint. Also using much smaller springs for tension, this time acting directly on the tubes making a sort of piston. Neat, and mostly keeps the lines tensioned, but sometimes the spring goes in the tube, also small springs make for little give. Also have nicer tying mechanism on the nylon wire using a buckle of sorts. Pressure tip simplified for assembly by needing gauges on a single side that bends into an S shape. Sturdier finger covers too. Using the same soldering helper as V, but with thinner silicon wires. Unfortunately the wrist joint is propped stuck because of the large number of stiff PTFE tubes going to the fingers. The middle finger is also hard to bend because of the tube going to the tip joint. It's also hard to get consistent tension on the springs. If tensioned too hard it becomes stuck. Also because of the PTFE stiffness the 2 sides of a joint don't tension independently, which is the primary reason for the tensioning system, to prevent an unwind on the side that's relaxing.
7. Mechahand VII. Direct nylon pathing through center of joints. This design ditches the PTFE guides in favour of the direct pathing. Though still using the thick PTFE tube as a make shift piston for the new tensioning system. Instead of pushing 2 guide tubes apart, we now pull 2 end of the wire together. The wires slide past eachother to compress on a spring, guided by the thick PTFE tube and some plastic bits. Works with the long and easy to compress springs. When the plastic bits touch we also stop compressing the spring and can pass the full motor tension. Large springs means a large give, but hopefully not too much tension on the relaxing side. Can't test this hand until fully designed due to the tension being held by the hand structure. The hand structure is made much more rigid using proper bearings and thick plastic construction. Wrist pivots on bearings on both sides for structural integrity. Wrist roll now has the position potentiometer on a gear, and a large channel through the middle for the tendon wires. Removing battery from hand case, assuming external power source. Also to conserve space as new motor arrangement needs a lot of middle space for the tensioners. However no space on the side needed for the tensioning guides. Dropping the soldering helper in favour of dupont connectors for the fingers, and direct soldering for the motors. The extra connectors on the finger should help with assembly, as the finger cables can be separated from the motor.  Thicker plastic parts make for sturdier looking aesthetics, also the base cover. The middle covers, are also above some nuts and bolts and as packed as they can be, allowing for movement. Fingers crossed!
