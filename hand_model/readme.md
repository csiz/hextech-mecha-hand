Physical Mechahand Model
------------------------

1. No files for first iteration of mechahand, see [blog post](http://calin.mocanu.info/2019/06/11/mechahand-assemble.html) for pictures.
2. Mechahand II, the smallest hand version, failed due to pulley system cables passing through sharp corners. Can't have the cables passing through any corner as tensioning that wire causes large friction increase and a lot of plastic deformation of the nylon wire.
