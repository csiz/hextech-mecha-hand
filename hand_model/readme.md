Physical Mechahand Model
------------------------

1. No files for first iteration of mechahand, see [blog post](http://calin.mocanu.info/2019/06/11/mechahand-assemble.html) for pictures.
2. Mechahand II, the smallest hand version, failed due to pulley system cables passing through sharp corners. Can't have the cables passing through any corner as tensioning that wire causes large friction increase and a lot of plastic deformation of the nylon wire.
3. Mechahand III, the hand with the motors directly in the palm, failed because it's way too big and flimsy. Can't put motors on the fingers because they end up being too heavy and too big. Not way to cramp them tighter either. The 3rd version has a very modular design with each finger segment and wrist joint taken from 2 joint modules. Motorzied bigjoint is a sturdy and higher reduction joint for the wrist assembly. Motorized minijoint are perpendicularly geared joints as small as I can make with 1 motor and 1 potentiometer. Modularizing the hand was a good idea, and bigjoint is used in later versions.
4. Mechahand IV, first fully functional version, blog post pending. Uses the motorized bigjoint module for the wrist. There are direct drive joints with in-situ motors for the thumb and pinky opposable finger grasp. The rest of the fingers are controller by 1-sided pulley system; with the other side being a passive spring. With 2-sided pulleys on the old versions, there isn't enough tension on the string to gracefully unwind the side opposite the movement direction. We end up with loose wire coming out of the motor system and tangling up. There's no way to fix it without unreasonable tension on both sides. I therefore choose a single side pulley with a passive spring which keeps the system always in tension. We only need to be careful not to unwind when there's an external blocker.
5. Mechahand V, current version.
