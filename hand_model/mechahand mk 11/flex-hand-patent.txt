Flexible sensor circuit for robotic hand
========================================

The invention consists of a flexible printed circuit board assembly which contains sensors for a multi segmented
robotic hand. The assembly consists of the palm circuit board containing sensors and supporting chips as well as
connectors to the flexible finger circuits and the controller in the forearm.


There are two innovations I would like to cover:

1. The first is using a single flexible circuit piece to connect multiple rigid segments that can actuate at the
joints. The joint positions are measured by encoders placed on stiff regions of the flexible circuit which clip
into channels designed into the structure of the robot segments. The connections to the encoders are flexible to
accommodate the variable shape of the robot while maintaining stable electrical connectivity. Relief loops are
incorporated into the design where it is necessary to flex over a wide range of angles. Additionally the circuit
is routed through the center of rotation of each joint allowing for minimal elongation and therefore low stresses.

2. The second innovation comprises the integrated force sensors. These sensors are formed by two electrodes
printed on the circuit which are then folded over double sided adhesive tape pads to form adjustable capacitors.
Using capacitance to digital converter chips (commonly found in touch screens and touch buttons) we can measure
the change in capacitance when the adhesive tape gets squished and the electrodes on each side come closer together.


Advantages
----------

My circuit design solves a number of problems present in robot hands available on the market:
* A big advantage is lower cost due to simplifying assembly and minimizing the number of individual components
required. Once assembled at a PCB manufacturing facility the circuit doesn't require any extra soldering on the
final robot assembly and the circuit clips directly into position in channels designed into the robot structure.
* Another issue solved by my circuit is the ability to directly measure joint positions using magnetic rotation
encoders placed on the axis of rotation. Most other robotic hands measure the motor servo positions that connect
to the fingers through tendons; this method of measuring position has lower accuracy because the tendons can
stretch and have additional backlash. My design can measure this backlash and correct for it in software.
* The force sensors in this design are integrated into the circuit using electrodes made by common copper etching
manufacturing and utilise cheap touch sensor chips. Other techniques like strain gauges, or pressure sensitive
resistive wire require separate manufacturing techniques using specialized metals, and they require additional
assembly to electrically connect the specialized sensor to the main circuit.
