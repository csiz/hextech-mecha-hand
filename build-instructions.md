Building Hextech Mechahand mk 10
================================

Components and tools
--------------------

Buy all the parts required in the bill of materials.

Order mostly assembled driving PCBs using the gerber files from `24drive`. Designed for assembly by jlcpcb.com, the
pick and place and electronics bill of materials are also available in the required formats. Manual assembly of the
driving PCB would require separately purchasing and soldering surface mount components. Machine assembly is better!

You should also prepare the following tools, and know how to use them:
* Protective glasses! PLA and nylon wires break suddenly and throw shards.
* 3D printer. Components are designed to be printed with 0.4mm nozzle FDM printer. Resin printers should also work.
* Soldering iron, solder, flux, and bronze sponge. Position encoders are embedded in plastic and soldered in place, practice fast soldering.
* Voltmeter. Need to test all connections after soldering, especially the strain gauges.
* Pliers, cutters, and tweezers. Multiple types of pliers recommended; flat for placing parts, round for handling wires, sharp for cutting tough nylon braid.
* Screwdriver or hex key with M3 head. Preferably a motorized screwdriver, there's going to be a lot of screwing.
* Crimping tool.
* Hammer!
