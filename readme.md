The project contains code for a 24 channel driver, the 3D printable model of the hand, and code to control the hand with a leap sensors. Details in the readme file of each folder.

* 24driver: Code and circuit design for a 24 channel PID controller. With wireless interface and also 12 pressure sensor inputs.
* hand_model: 3D model and instructions for the mecha-hand versions.
* leap_control: Code to control the hand via the leap motion sensor.
* unused_libs: Buttons and encoder libs I didn't end up using, will be deleted when I find a better home for them.
